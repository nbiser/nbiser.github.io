  <p><strong>In the chart above, the vertical line marks November 2021, when I assumed full ownership of sales operations at SkidSteerCabs.
  </strong> Before this point, I supported marketing and assisted with sales part time. As I transitioned into full responsibility, performance 
  ramped up and then held steady moving forward.</p>
  
  <ul class="sales-stats">
    <li><strong>Nov 2021:</strong> Took full ownership of sales operations.</li>
    <li><strong>2022:</strong> Revenue grew <strong>+67% YoY</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>2023:</strong> Revenue stabilized at <strong>~+42% vs 2021</strong>, while order volume continued to rise, reflecting sustained demand and process gains.</li>
    <li><strong>Trend:</strong> Average monthly revenue rose sharply after November 2021 and remained above pre-start levels.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Established Sales Processes</h2>
<p>When I took ownership of sales at SSC there was no formal sales process...no follow ups, no pipeline, and little automation. I quickly set up a pipeline
in Highlevel CRM, and set up an effective but simple sales process to fully engage with and close leads. I also helped set up our automated follow up system, from abandoned
checkout emails, texts to cold leads, and checkins with customers who had already purchased.</p>

<h2>Set Up New Partners</h2>
<p>I spearheaded setting up new partnerships with numerous suppliers, including attachment manufacturers Eterra, Digga, and Haugen, along with the Heavy Equipment 
parts suppliers AMS Parts and Depco. This required a large website effort to add and optimize the new products, learning about the mechanical specifications for heavy equipment attachments,
and selling the new products to customers. I tackled the challenge, and those various distributors now form a major part of SSCs business.</p>

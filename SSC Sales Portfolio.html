<p>In the above image you can see the vertical line shows where I fully took ownership of 
sales operations at SSC. Before that I worked on the marketing for a time, and helped 
with sales on the side. You can see the ramp up as I became more and more involved. 
<ul>Took full ownership of sales operations Nov 2021. Revenue grew +67% YoY in 2022. In 2023, revenue stabilized at +~42% vs 2021, 
while order volume continued to rise, reflecting sustained demand and process gains.</ul>

<ul>Average monthly revenue increased sharply after Nov 2021 and remained above pre-start levels throughout 2023.</ul>

<h2>First Year of Sales Management at SSC</h2>
<p>In the above image you can see the vertical line shows where I fully took ownership of 
sales operations at SSC. Before that I worked on the marketing for a time, and helped 
with only sales as needed on a part time basis. You can see the ramp up as I became more and more involved. The dotted line shows when I started, and 
you can see the ramp up in sales truly begin about a month before as I took over more and more. 
<ul>I Took full ownership of sales operations Nov 2021. Revenue grew +67% YoY in 2022. In 2023, revenue stabilized at +~42% vs 2021, 
while order volume continued to rise, reflecting sustained demand and process gains. </ul>
</div>
<ul>Average monthly revenue increased sharply after Nov 2021 and remained above pre-start levels throughout 2023. <b>I have left off more recent year
at request of ownership at SSC for privacy purposes</b></ul>

<h3>Established Sales Processes</h3>
<p>When I took ownership of sales at SSC there was no formal sales process...no follow ups, no pipeline, and little automation. I quickly set up a pipeline
in Highlevel CRM, and set up an effective but simple sales process to fully capture leads. I also helped set up our automated follow up system, from abandoned
checkout emails, texts to cold leads, and checkins with customers who had already purchased.</p>

<h3>Set Up New Partners</h3>
<p>I spearheaded setting up new partnerships with numerous suppliers, including attachment manufacturers Eterra, Digga, and Haugen, along with the Heavy Equipment 
parts suppliers AMS Parts and Depco. This required a large website effort to add and optimize the new products, learning about the mechanical specifications, and selling
the new products to customers. I tackled the challenge, and those various distributors now form a major part of SSCs business.</p>

      <h2 id="ssc-sales-title">Impact After I Took Over Sales at SSC</h2>

      <p class="lede">
        I fully took over leading sales operations for SSC in November of 2021. I quickly focused on tightening the sales process by building a structured pipeline focosed on rapid
        followup with customers and making sure that I properly engaged with leads, and followed up with customers that didn't purchase right away. As time went on I added more products to the site to complement our existing doors and cab kits, including additional heavy equipment attachments, final drives and other parts. This resulted in exponential growth to sales numbers, as seen in the illustration below.

      <h3>Highlight on Quote Performance</h3>
      <p>I put a strong focus on a pipeline that listened the customer's needs, pivoted to a product that fixed that need, quoting them for the product, and then following up on that quote. I also strengthened the automations
      used by SSC, from aboned checkout emails, automated texts to warm and cold leads, and post purchase checkins. This was especially reflected in the number of quotes sent, the value of the quotes, and the high close rate
      that I maintained.<p>
      <h3>New Supplier Partnerships</h3>
      <p>
        I led partnerships with attachment brands like <strong>Eterra</strong>, <strong>Digga</strong>, and <strong>Haugen</strong>, and parts suppliers like
        <strong>AMS Parts</strong> and <strong>Depco</strong>. That meant building and optimizing new product pages, learning the techincal specs,
        and selling them effectively. Those product lines from those vendors now make up a meaningful slice of SSC’s business. </p>

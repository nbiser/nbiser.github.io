<h2>First Year of Sales Management at SSC</h2>
<p>In the above image you can see the vertical line shows where I fully took ownership of 
sales operations at SSC. Before that I worked on the marketing for a time, and helped 
with only sales as needed on a part time basis. You can see the ramp up as I became more and more involved. The dotted line shows when I started, and 
you can see the ramp up in sales truly begin about a month before as I took over more and more. 
<ul>I Took full ownership of sales operations Nov 2021. Revenue grew +67% YoY in 2022. In 2023, revenue stabilized at +~42% vs 2021, 
while order volume continued to rise, reflecting sustained demand and process gains. </ul>
<ul>Average monthly revenue increased sharply after Nov 2021 and remained above pre-start levels throughout 2023. <b>I have left off more recent year
at request of ownership at SSC for privacy purposes</b></ul>

<h2>Established Sales Processes</h2>
<p>When I took ownership of sales at SSC there was no formal sales process...no follow ups, no pipeline, and little automation. I quickly set up a pipeline
in Highlevel CRM, and set up an effective but simple sales process to fully capture leads. I also helped set up our automated follow up system, from abandoned
checkout emails, texts to cold leads, and checkins with customers who had already purchased.</p>

<h2>Set Up New Partners</h2>
<p>I spearheaded setting up new partnerships with numerous suppliers, including attachment manufacturers Eterra, Digga, and Haugen, along with the Heavy Equipment 
parts suppliers AMS Parts and Depco. This required a large website effort to add and optimize the new products, learning about the mechanical specifications, and selling
the new products to customers. I tackled the challenge, and those various distributors now form a major part of SSCs business.</p>

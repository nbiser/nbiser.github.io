    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a marketing and sales professional with over 8 years of experience in sales and marketing across retail, automotive, and e-commerce. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Most recently, I’ve grown <strong>SkidSteerCabs.com</strong> through SEO optimization, email marketing, Google Ads, Facebook marketing, and inbound sales. 
      Before that I worked at Timbrook Nissan, managing the website, heading our various digital marketing efforts, and handling new/used 
      vehicle sales from when their lead came through to the CRM to when they drove their new vehicle off the lot. My experience gives me a unique combination
      of customer service, inbound and outbound sales, management, and marketing skills that I love to leverage to create happy customers. 
      I enjoy research, problem-solving, and applying creative strategies that convert simple customers into long-term partners.
